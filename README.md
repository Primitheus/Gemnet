# Gemnet
Rumble Fighter/Gem Fighter Server Emulator.

This emulator is backwards compatible with all if not most versions of Rumble Fighter with very limited functionality.
Testing is done on the latest build and very limited testing on a old 2007 build.

No testing or plans is currently being made for anything specific to Gem Fighter, however porting it to Gem Fighter shouldn't be a difficult task.
