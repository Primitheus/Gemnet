# Gemnet
Rumble Fighter/Gem Fighter Server Emulator.

No testing or plans is currently being made for anything specific to Gem Fighter, however porting it to Gem Fighter shouldn't be a difficult task.

WARNING: This project essentially comes with no support, you cannot connect to the Server out of the box because you need a modified game client which I cannot provide. However, that doesn't stop you from contributing by refactoring code or fixing my spaghetti server code.
