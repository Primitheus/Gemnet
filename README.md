# Gemnet
Rumble Fighter/Gem Fighter Server Emulator.

This emulator is backwards compatible with all if not most versions of Rumble Fighter.
Testing is done on an early 2007 build of the game and the newest build of the game.

No testing or plans is currently being made for anything specific to Gem Fighter, however porting it to Gem Fighter shouldn't be a difficult task.
